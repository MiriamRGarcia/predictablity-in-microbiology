- 1980/81 First survival fraction model as a function of electric field strength $E$ and total treatment time $\tau$ (using as parametres the $E_c$ criitical electric field strength, $\tau_c$ critical treatment time and $K$ the kinetic constant) . Note that increasing the amplitude of electric pulses is much more effective than lengthening the treatment time, which is consistent with the experimental observations [Saulis_2010](../posts/Saulis_2010.md)

  S=\left(\frac{\tau}{\tau_c}\right)^{-\frac{E-E_c}{K}}

- Measure if a cell is porated or not if an increase in membrane permeability (under the influence of an electric pulse or spontaneously) to the smallest ions (Na+, K+, Rb+) must be such that it can be distinguished from the background level of permeability. ([Saulis_1993](../posts/Saulis_1993.md))
- pores induced by exposure to an electric pulse leading to the poration of almost 100% of the cells are smaller than 0.5-1.0 nm ([Saulis_1993](../posts/Saulis_1993.md))
- Schemnatic representation of the process  [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12393-010-9023-3/figures/1)
- Equations relating electrical field with transmembrane potential. It depends of the type of wave (square-wave, pulse) see for example [Saulis_2010](../posts/Saulis_2010.md)
