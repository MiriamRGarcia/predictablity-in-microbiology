# Can we predict bacterial electroporation?

## Paper

[Jaeger, H., Meneses, N., Knorr, D., 2009. Impact of PEF treatment inhomogeneity such as electric field distribution, flow characteristics and temperature effects on the inactivation of E. coli and milk alkaline phosphatase. Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies 10, 470–480](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2009.03.001)

## What is being predicted?

The fluid flow and spatial distrubtion of temperature field and electrical potential in raw milk in a co-linear treatment chamber when adding a grid.

## How?

Numerically solving the 3 Partial derivative equations using Finite Element Methods in COMSOL

## Limitations/open problems

Although the study evaluates the effect of adding a grid on microbial inactivation (and on milk alkaline phosphatase), this impact was not modelled, only measured experimentally.
