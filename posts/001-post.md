# Can we predict antimicrobial resistance evolution?

**Paper**

[Charlebois, D.A., 2023. Quantitative systems-based prediction of antimicrobial resistance evolution. npj Syst Biol Appl 9, 40.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41540-023-00304-6)

**What is being predicted**

The review shows that AMR prediction focuses on probabilities of resistance mutations, likely evolutionary endpoints, and short‑term phenotypic or fitness changes, rather than exact mutational sequences. Predictability tends to increase at higher biological scales (e.g., resistance mechanisms or phenotypes) and decreases at very fine genetic resolution. Crucially, under strong and consistent selective pressures, microbial evolution often converges, making resistance outcomes more predictable and more repeatable across independent experiments.

**How**

A systems‑biology perspective strengthens prediction by integrating multiple layers of quantitative data. This includes probability distributions, stochastic population models, fitness landscapes, multiscale ‑omics measurements, and high‑replicate evolution experiments. Techniques such as lineage barcoding help track low‑frequency variants and reveal convergent trajectories. Systems‑level models can therefore capture both deterministic and stochastic components of AMR, while machine learning is emerging but still largely non‑mechanistic

**Limitations/open problems**

Predictability is constrained by random mutations, genetic drift, epistasis, and the enormous dimensionality of genotype space, all of which introduce divergence in evolutionary paths. Environmental complexity and incomplete data further reduce accuracy. The authors emphasise that only short‑timescale microevolution is meaningfully predictable, whereas macroevolution remains unreachable. However, they also show that strong selection narrows evolutionary options, increasing repeatability and thus improving predictability—a key insight for designing experiments and potentially for shaping therapeutic strategies.
