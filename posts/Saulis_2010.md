# Can we predict bacterial electroporation?

## Paper

[Saulis, Gintautas. “Electroporation of Cell Membranes: The Fundamental Effects of Pulsed Electric Fields in Food Processing.” *Food Engineering Reviews* 2, no. 2 (2010): 52–73](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12393-010-9023-3).

## What is being predicted?

Cell electroporation to describe this can be seen [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12393-010-9023-3/figures/1)

## How?

It discusses the mechanisms of electroporesis with three leves of damage (1) electroporation, (2) electropermeabilization and (3) Cell death/inactivation (see figure). For modelling this under PEF there are certain steps that should be considered and modelled

- The increase in the transmembrane Potential by an external Electric Field
- Pore initiation Stage

## Limitations/open problems

<!-- In most of the models of transmembrane Potential  the resting potential is disregarded  (assumed 0). -->
