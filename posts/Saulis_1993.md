# Can we predict bacterial electroporation?

## Paper

[Saulis, G., Venslauskas, M.S., 1993. Cell electroporation Part 1. Theoretical simulation of the process of pore formation in a cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/0302-4598(93)80047-X)

## What is being predicted?

Theoretically a general equation describing the following two important characteristics of the cell electroporation process: 

- **Distribution function of cell poration times:** the dependence of the probability that a cell is porated on the pulse duration at a fixed electric field strength 

- **Distribution function of cell poration field strengths:** the dependence of the probability that a cell is porated on the field strength at a fixed pulse length 

## How?

Theoretical derivation assuming a random one-step process, therefore with Poisson distributions.

## Limitations/open problems

The assumptions considered, such as

- only one type of pores appear, therefore with the same structure, i.e. have the same energy barrier, radios and dependence of pore energy on transmembrane voltage.

- Pores do not interact

(see page 224 for other assumptions)

## Other relevant data in this work

- Measure if a cell is porated or not if an increase in membrane permeability (under the influence of an electric pulse or spontaneously) to the smallest ions (Na+, K+, Rb+) must be such that it can be distinguished from the background   level of permeability.
- pores induced by exposure to an electric pulse leading to the poration of almost 100% of the cells are smaller than 0.5-1.0 nm
