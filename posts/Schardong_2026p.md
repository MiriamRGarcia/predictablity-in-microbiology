Antimicrobial resistance. The work is a systematic review of mathematical models of AMR in recent years (2019–2024).

## How

Using mathematical modelling. It divides the type of studies into:

- Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships

- Within-host models

- Only one of the studies adopted a One Health perspective, employing a multiscale modelling approach.

Formalisms:

- Deterministic models, often through ODEs (most common)

- Stochastic simulations, such as those generated by the Gillespie algorithm

- Others including PDEs, ABMs

## Limitations/open problems

- Almost no works (only one found) studying AMR in the One Health framework.

- Most focus on bacteria, while viral, fungal, and parasitic AMR are not practically mentioned.

- Most focus on simple pathways of resistance acquisition.

- Spatial heterogeneity is rarely considered.

- Multi‑drug interactions.

- Ecological interactions.
